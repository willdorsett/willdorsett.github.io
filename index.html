					<h2>About Me</h2>
				</header>

				<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/about-me.jpg" alt="" /></a>

				<p>	I'm curently working in customer service but I am diving into web development.<br> Computers have always been interesting to me, in my childhood I would collect discarded computer parts from the trash to take them apart and learn about them.
					this eventually developed into an obsession with coding.  I looked into python because I wanted to learn how to code a video game.  Video games qualify as a hobby but borderline on an obsession.  After learning about PyGame,
					I looked into web development and after finding websites like freecodecamp.org and theodinproject.com, I was hooked and I had to know everything that I could about fulls tack web development.  After looking online, mostly reddit, 
					I found out about The Web Developer Bootcamp, taught by Colt Steele.  I jumped in shelling out my own money, because this was how I would prove to myself that I was truly ready and willing to dive feet first into this.</p>
						
				<p>	<br>I unfortunately had to take a break from learning full stack web development as I am a student in a Masters Degree program, between that and a full time job, I didn't have a lot of time to invest in learning full stack development.  Then Covid happened, and I found myself with a lot more free time as I was working from home primarily.  
					I decided to restart the course to make sure that I didn't miss anything and Colt had revamped the course adding a lot of information. I found that I had been bitten by the bug even harder and found myself staying up late, and utilizing every bit of free tiem that I have to be as prepared as I can be. 
					I have now finished this course and used the information from the bootcamp, freecodecamp.org and theodinproject.com to develop this website, and the projects list.
				</p>
				<p>
					I am seeking a full-time role where I can contribute my skills both in coding and business to help a company achieve their goals.
				</p>	
				<p>	<b>Skills:</b> HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, AJAX, DOM
					Manipulation, NodeJS, ExpressJS, REST, SQL, NoSQL, MongoDB, Schema Design, Authentication from
					scratch, Common Security Issues such as SQL Injection, ESS, Deploying Apps, Cloud Databases, Image
					Upload and Storage, Maps and Geocoding, and more.
